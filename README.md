# kodilla-checkers

My first application from Kodilla course - Checkers
Right now only display board and you can make move of pawn.

Need to add:
1. Bloke to making move forward only diagonally
2. Make a attack.
3. Make a multiply attacks.
4. Add logic to recognize player.
5. Add queen and possible moves.
6. Add possibility to play against "computer".
